# Notification System
# TODO: Configure notification providers and alerts
#
# Flux supports multiple notification providers:
# - Discord (webhooks)
# - Slack (webhooks) 
# - Microsoft Teams
# - Email (SMTP)
# - Webhook (generic)
#
# Resources to create:
# 1. Provider resources (Discord, Slack, etc.)
# 2. Alert resources (what to monitor)
# 3. Encrypted secrets for webhooks/tokens
# 4. Event filtering and routing
#
# Common alerts to configure:
# - Flux reconciliation failures
# - Application deployment status
# - Monitoring alerts (when monitoring is added)
# - Infrastructure issues
